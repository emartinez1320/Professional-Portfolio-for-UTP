# Professional-Portfolio-for-UTP
This repo is a portfolio that will include projects and will be constantly updated and improved as I continue to learn. 
The challenge:

User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport. 

The title of this project is Professional-Portfolio-for_UTP. 
I was assigned to make a website that would contain my portfolio for employers to view. 
The website i created has basic information such as my name, contact information, a little about me, and more importantly a section for my portfolio. I am looking to add more and more as I continue to learn more and exciting elements and languages. This webpage will be updated constantly. 

I only used HTML and CSS for this webpage. 

When you open up the webpage you will see a responsive Navbar that will take you to any section you select. All Photos were Taken by friends of mine who were okay with me using their pictures. 

When scrolling down to my portfolio you can see my "Projects" in sections, the most recent application will be the bigger then the the rest.
Scrolling down to contact info you will see a list of random socials. <!--I did not actually include my personal information. I wasnt sure if I was suppose to.-->
